00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Thanks to this man, many people have seen math again, which they thought was difficult and complicated.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,900
It's a great honor given to mathematicians.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,700
Professor Heo Joon-hee, who received the Fields Award, returned from the awards ceremony last weekend and came out to KBS today.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,900
Let's meet him quickly.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,100
Professor, how are you?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,400
Hello.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I heard that you heard that you were going to receive the Fields Award early this year.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
When exactly is it?

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't remember the exact date, but it was supposed to be delivered to the Russian President, so I think it was just before the war.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,700
So you've been living as a secret mathematician for a while.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,299
How did you feel?

12
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:53,900
After hearing the news, I thought I should at least talk to my wife, other than other executives and PR people.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,099
I looked for my wife, and she was sleeping because it was late at night.

14
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:07,599
So I thought for a moment, and when I woke her up and talked to her, she fell asleep again.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:18,599
Rather than cheering and hugging her, she responded calmly, so I felt good and reassured.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,400
You've seen a lot of domestic reactions, but the process of growth has become a hot topic.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:34,800
You went to elementary school and university in Korea, but you are evaluated as an exceptional achievement in Korean education, not an achievement achieved by Korean education.

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,199
What do you think of yourself?

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:52,699
If I remember my childhood, I was a quiet, introverted, and ordinary child who was not special or special.

20
00:01:52,699 --> 00:02:04,599
After that, I went to elementary, middle, and high school, and I was influenced by many special and outstanding friends and teachers.

21
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,699
I think I've been making myself little by little while learning.

22
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:23,000
Of course, it wasn't always easy, but as many people do, I learned a lot of things I know now in the first half of my life, growing up in the fence of education.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,199
In that sense, I think it was a very valuable time for me.

24
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,000
It was a valuable experience.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,100
You said that the winding road you walked on was the best path for you.

26
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:45,199
One of them is that you dreamed of being a poet once, and your favorite poem is the poem of Ki Young-do, Jealousy is My Power.

27
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Why do you like this poem?

28
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:57,000
At that time, I felt like I was expressing my feelings well, and I had a strong desire to fully understand what was deep inside me.

29
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:09,600
But I'm sorry to my middle school self, but I think it was because I wasn't treated when I was in middle school.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:20,699
Looking back, I had a strong desire to become a person who wrote a great poem rather than a desire to write a great poem.

31
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:27,000
I think I couldn't go far on the road of poetry because I lacked sincerity.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I heard that you thought about becoming a scientist if you couldn't be a poet.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There are scientists in KBS, too.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why is that?

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:51,300
As a writer, I had a hobby and aptitude for science, so I thought it would be difficult to make a living as a poet, and then I thought of it as a realistic route.

36
00:03:51,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Of course, being a science journalist is a great job, but I personally don't have any regrets.

37
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:14,600
It's amazing that the route I chose for a realistic reason led me to a better way than the best way I thought at the time, and I'm grateful to myself.

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,600
When you came to the airport last week, you met your 8-year-old son, right?

39
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I can see the picture, and I'm sure you went to school.

40
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm sure a lot of parents are curious.

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Is there a math education method for your father, Heo Joon?

42
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,899
My son, Dan, and I do one math problem a day.

43
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:43,899
When Dan makes a math problem, I solve it and Dan scores it and returns it.

44
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,899
It's not a big problem.

45
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:52,899
It's a problem like drawing a few circles and guessing how many circles there are.

46
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I was so good at guessing, so Dan told me to draw as many circles as I could and guess how many there were.

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Dan doesn't know math yet, but when he has to count exactly 130 circles,

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,500
If I draw 130 circles in 10 lines, I guess there are 130 in total,

49
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
and if I draw 130 circles randomly without any rules,

50
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I realize that I made a mistake after suffering for a while.

51
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
As a parent, I was very proud.

52
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,500
As you know, Korea is a country that risks its life for math because of the entrance exam.

53
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:43,799
There are many students who solve the entrance exam well, but there are no real math students.

54
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,799
Why do you think so?

55
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,799
It's a difficult topic.

56
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:59,799
I think it's because we use our precious school days not to study, but to be evaluated.

57
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:12,100
I hope that students with aptitude can learn without hesitation without worry that they have to solve it quickly without mistakes.

58
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:25,100
And I hope that students in their 20s will be well prepared when they go to college and start learning their major.

59
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:33,399
In the case of students, I'm sure it's a lot of pressure to take the entrance exam that can determine their lives,

60
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:39,399
but I hope they don't get intimidated and study what they want without making mistakes,

61
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:45,399
but what they want to study without hesitation.

62
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:55,700
And I hope that social adults will set up a good system so that the courage of such students will not be betrayed.

63
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
I think it's a related story.

64
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Lastly, we asked the viewers in advance.

65
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,700
We prepared a chalkboard and a chalkboard that the professor likes to use and asked for a simple greeting.

66
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,700
I hope you study steadily and happily with a healthy mind.

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What did you want to emphasize?

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The most important progress in science and mathematics is not to achieve a project that you already understand to some extent,

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,000
but to be purely interested and curious.

70
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:39,299
But in order to have such a pleasant and curious mind,

71
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:46,299
you have to be healthy and enjoy the act of thinking, so I wrote it in that sense.

72
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:51,299
I heard that Professor Heo Joon-hee has a notebook that he wrote the role model of his life.

73
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:57,299
I hope there will be more students who enjoy math with the goal of Heo Joon-hee in the future.

74
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,299
Thank you for coming today.

75
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:01,299
Thank you.

76
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,299
Thank you.
